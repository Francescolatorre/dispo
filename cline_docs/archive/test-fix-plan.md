# Authentication Test Fix Plan

## Current Issue
The "should handle successful login" test is failing because localStorage.getItem('token') is returning null when it should be 'mock-jwt-token'. This indicates a potential race condition or timing issue between state updates and storage operations.

## Analysis
1. The test environment uses a mock localStorage implementation
2. The test case verifies both state and storage updates
3. The failure occurs specifically in the storage verification step

## Potential Solutions

### 1. Storage Implementation
- Current implementation might not be properly synchronizing storage operations
- Consider implementing a more robust mock storage with proper spies
- Ensure storage operations are atomic and synchronous

### 2. Test Environment
- State updates and storage operations might be out of sync
- Consider implementing a more reliable state management pattern
- Ensure proper order of operations in the test environment

### 3. Test Case Structure
- Async operations might not be properly handled
- Consider improving waitFor conditions and timeouts
- Add better error handling and state verification

## Recommended Approach
1. Start with improving the localStorage mock implementation:
   - Use a proper Map-based storage
   - Add proper spies on all storage operations
   - Ensure synchronous operation

2. If that doesn't resolve the issue, modify the test environment to:
   - Ensure state updates complete before storage operations
   - Add better error handling
   - Improve async operation handling

3. Finally, if needed, update the test case to:
   - Add better async handling
   - Improve waitFor conditions
   - Add better state verification

## Success Criteria
1. All tests pass consistently
2. No race conditions or timing issues
3. Clear and maintainable test code
4. Proper error handling and state verification
