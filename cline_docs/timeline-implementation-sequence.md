# Timeline Implementation Sequence

## Current Status
- PostgreSQL MCP server setup in progress
- End-to-end tests exist for core functionality
- Basic timeline component structure exists

## Prerequisites (P1)
1. Complete PostgreSQL MCP Server Setup
   - Verify server connection
   - Test database connectivity
   - Document available tools
   - Status: In Progress (see activeContext.md)

2. Verify End-to-End Test Coverage
   - Run existing e2e tests (employees, navigation, projects)
   - Verify test environment setup
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Status: Needs Verification

3. Basic Page Loading
   - Verify route configuration
   - Check component mounting
   - Test data fetching
   - Status: Needs Verification

## Timeline Component Implementation (P2)
Only proceed after all prerequisites are met.

### Phase 1: Core Timeline
1. Basic Timeline View
   - Date-based visualization
   - Project assignment display
   - Basic interaction handlers

2. Data Integration
   - Connect to backend services
   - Implement data fetching
   - Handle loading states

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
1. Filtering Capabilities
   - Project filter
   - Employee filter
   - Date range selection

2. Workload Indicators
   - Capacity visualization
   - Overallocation warnings
   - Resource utilization metrics

## Success Criteria
1. All prerequisite tasks completed and verified
2. End-to-end tests passing
3. Timeline component loads and displays data correctly
4. Filtering functionality works as expected
5. Workload indicators provide accurate information

## Next Steps
1. Complete PostgreSQL MCP server setup
2. Run and verify all end-to-end tests
3. Test basic page loading functionality
4. Update this document with verification results
5. Begin timeline implementation only after all prerequisites are met
