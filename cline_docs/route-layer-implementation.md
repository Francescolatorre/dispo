# Route Layer Implementation Plan

## Project Requirements Implementation

### Overview
We need to implement the routes for managing project requirements, following our established patterns for validation, error handling, and logging.

### Components Status

#### Completed ✓
1. Validation Schema
   - Created requirement schema with all fields
   - Added validation for dates and relationships
   - Implemented update schema

2. Repository Layer
   - Implemented CRUD operations
   - Added transaction support
   - Implemented error handling
   - Added project relationship validation

3. Service Layer
   - Implemented business logic
   - Added comprehensive logging
   - Added transaction support
   - Implemented status management

### Next Steps

#### 1. Requirement Routes Implementation (2 days)

##### Day 1: Core Routes
1. GET /api/requirements
   - List requirements with pagination
   - Support filtering by project, status, priority
   - Include proper error handling
   - Add logging

2. GET /api/requirements/:id
   - Get single requirement details
   - Handle not found cases
   - Add logging

3. POST /api/requirements
   - Create new requirement
   - Validate input using schema
   - Handle project relationship
   - Add logging

4. PUT /api/requirements/:id
   - Update requirement details
   - Validate input using schema
   - Handle not found cases
   - Add logging

5. DELETE /api/requirements/:id
   - Delete requirement
   - Handle not found cases
   - Add logging

##### Day 2: Additional Routes
1. GET /api/projects/:id/requirements
   - List requirements for specific project
   - Add pagination support
   - Handle not found cases
   - Add logging

2. PUT /api/requirements/:id/status
   - Update requirement status
   - Handle assignment relationships
   - Add logging

#### 2. Test Implementation (2 days)

##### Day 1: Core Tests
1. Setup Test Environment
   - Create test data helpers
   - Set up requirement fixtures
   - Configure test database state

2. Core Route Tests
   - Test list requirements
   - Test get single requirement
   - Test create requirement
   - Test update requirement
   - Test delete requirement

##### Day 2: Advanced Tests
1. Validation Tests
   - Test input validation
   - Test date validation
   - Test relationship validation

2. Error Handling Tests
   - Test not found scenarios
   - Test conflict scenarios
   - Test validation errors

3. Integration Tests
   - Test project relationships
   - Test assignment relationships
   - Test status transitions

### Success Criteria

#### 1. Functionality
- All CRUD operations working
- Proper validation in place
- Correct error handling
- Proper relationship management

#### 2. Code Quality
- Follows established patterns
- Proper logging implemented
- Transaction support working
- Clean code structure

#### 3. Testing
- High test coverage
- All edge cases covered
- Integration tests passing
- Performance tests passing

### Implementation Guidelines

#### 1. Error Handling
- Use custom error classes
- Proper error messages
- Consistent error responses
- Proper logging

#### 2. Validation
- Use schema validation
- Validate relationships
- Validate date ranges
- Validate status transitions

#### 3. Logging
- Log all operations
- Include context
- Log errors properly
- Log performance metrics

#### 4. Testing
- Unit tests for each route
- Integration tests
- Error scenario tests
- Performance tests

### Next Phase
Once requirement routes are complete, we can move to Phase 5: Database Access Cleanup, which includes:
1. Remove remaining direct pool usage
2. Update test utilities
3. Add monitoring
4. Performance optimization

### Dependencies
- Project routes must be complete ✓
- Repository pattern implemented ✓
- Service layer complete ✓
- Validation schemas ready ✓

### Timeline
- Day 1-2: Implement routes
- Day 3-4: Implement tests
- Day 5: Review and cleanup

### Monitoring & Validation
1. Performance Metrics
   - Response times
   - Query execution times
   - Error rates
   - Success rates

2. Code Quality
   - Test coverage
   - Code complexity
   - Error handling
   - Documentation

3. Success Metrics
   - All tests passing
   - No direct database access
   - Proper error handling
   - Complete logging
