# Assignment Implementation Priorities

## Phase 1: Essential Assignment Management
Focus on core functionality that allows users to start managing assignments immediately.

### 1. Basic Assignment Form
```typescript
interface AssignmentFormProps {
  projectId?: number;    // Pre-filled for project context
  employeeId?: number;   // Pre-filled for employee context
  onSubmit: (data: CreateAssignmentDto) => Promise<void>;
  onCancel: () => void;
}
```

Components:
- Project selector (dropdown)
- Employee selector (dropdown)
- Date range picker
- Allocation slider (10% steps)
- Role input
- Submit/Cancel buttons

Validation:
- Basic field validation
- Date range within project
- Allocation steps of 10%

### 2. Assignment List View
Simple table view showing:
- Employee name
- Project name
- Date range
- Allocation
- Basic status

Features:
- Sort by columns
- Basic filters
- Edit/Delete actions

### 3. Simple Workload Display
- Show current allocation per employee
- Basic color coding (green/yellow/red)
- Simple warning messages

## Phase 2: Timeline Integration
Add visual timeline once basic management is working.

### 1. Basic Timeline Grid
- Week/month view
- Employee rows
- Basic assignment blocks
- Simple navigation

### 2. Timeline Interactions
- Click to create
- Click to edit
- Basic drag to set dates

### 3. Workload Visualization
- Color-coded bars
- Allocation percentages
- Basic tooltips

## Phase 3: Advanced Features
Add features that enhance usability after core functionality is stable.

### 1. Drag and Drop
- Drag to move assignments
- Resize handles
- Snap to grid

### 2. Advanced Validation
- Real-time workload calculation
- Conflict detection
- Warning system

### 3. Bulk Operations
- Multi-select
- Batch updates
- Copy/paste

## Success Metrics

### Must Have (Phase 1)
- [x] Create/edit assignments
- [x] View current workload
- [x] Basic validation
- [x] List view of assignments

### Should Have (Phase 2)

- [ ] Export features
- [ ] Custom views

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```typescript
// AssignmentForm.test.tsx
describe('AssignmentForm', () => {
  it('validates allocation steps', () => {});
  it('prevents invalid date ranges', () => {});
  it('shows workload warnings', () => {});
});
```

### Integration Tests
```typescript
describe('Assignment Management', () => {
  it('creates assignment with validation', () => {});
  it('shows correct workload', () => {});
  it('updates timeline display', () => {});
});
```
