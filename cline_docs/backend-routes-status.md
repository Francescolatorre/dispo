# Backend Routes Status

## Working Routes (Current Branch)

### Auth Routes ✓
- Complete implementation with:
  * Login with rate limiting
  * Token verification
  * Password reset
  * Comprehensive tests
  * Input validation
  * Error handling

### Employee Routes ✓
- Full CRUD operations
- Employee validation middleware
- Database integration
- Error handling

### Assignment Routes ✓
- Project assignment management
- Employee assignment tracking
- Availability checking
- Assignment history
- Termination handling

## Missing/Incomplete Routes

### Project Routes ❌
- Currently only a stub
- Need to port from main branch:
  * CRUD operations
  * Project validation
  * Manager assignment
  * Status management

### Requirements Routes ❓
- Status unknown
- Need to check main branch implementation

## Middleware Status

### Working Middleware ✓
- validateEmployee.js
  * Complete input validation
  * Email format checking
  * Work time factor validation
  * Required fields checking

- validateAssignment.js
  * Used in assignments.js
  * Functionality verified

### Missing/Unknown Middleware
- validateProject.js ❌
  * Needed for project routes
  * Must be ported from main branch

- validateRequirement.js ❓
  * Status unknown
  * Need to check main implementation

## Service Layer Status

### Working Services ✓
- assignmentService.js
  * Referenced in routes
  * Functionality complete

- requirementService.js
  * Present in codebase
  * Need to verify functionality

- workloadService.js
  * Present in codebase
  * Handles resource allocation
  * Capacity tracking

### Missing Services ❌
- projectService.js
  * Not present in codebase
  * Must be ported from main

## Next Steps

1. Create new branch from main
2. Copy over working auth implementation:
   - auth.js route
   - auth.test.js
   - Authentication middleware

3. Port missing components:
   - Complete projects.js implementation
   - Port validateProject.js middleware
   - Port projectService.js
   - Verify requirementService.js functionality

4. Verify all components:
   - Run all tests
   - Check middleware interactions
   - Verify service layer functionality
   - Test workload calculations

5. Continue with MVP development:
   - Focus on project management features
   - Implement timeline visualization
   - Add resource allocation features
   - Integrate workload tracking

## Dependencies to Check
- Database migrations for all tables
- Test environment setup
- API documentation
- Frontend service integration
- Workload calculation algorithms
