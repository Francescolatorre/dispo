## Next Steps

1. Begin Database Implementation
   - Execute initial schema migration
   - Verify indexes and constraints
   - Load test data for development
   - Validate rollback procedures

2. Start Backend Development
   - Implement API endpoints
   - Create service layer
   - Add validation middleware
   - Write unit tests

3. Initialize Frontend Development
   - Create base components
   - Implement forms
   - Add state management
   - Write component tests

4. Setup CI/CD Pipeline
   - Configure test automation
   - Set up deployment workflow
   - Add monitoring
   - Configure alerts

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- Database schema changes might affect existing data
- Performance impact of new indexes
- Integration with existing authentication system
- Frontend state management complexity

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Comprehensive testing before deployment
2. Phased rollout approach
3. Monitoring and alerting setup
4. Rollback procedures ready
5. Team training planned

## Resource Requirements
